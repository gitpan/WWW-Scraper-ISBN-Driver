WWW/Scraper/ISBN/Driver version 0.15
====================================

WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver - Driver class for WWW::Scraper::ISBN module.

This is a base class, all site-specific drivers should inherit its members and methods.  Driver
subclasses named '$name' should be packaged as WWW::Scraper::ISBN::$name_Driver, e.g.
WWW::Scraper::ISBN::LOC_Driver for LOC (Library of Congress) driver.  Each driver need only implement the
search() method, though they may have as many other methods as they need to get their job done.  Only
search() will be called by WWW::Scraper::ISBN->search()
