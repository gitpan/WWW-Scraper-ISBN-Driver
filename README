WWW-Scraper-ISBN-Driver
=======================

WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver - Driver class for WWW::Scraper::ISBN module.

This is a base class, from which all site-specific drivers should inherit its 
members and methods.  Driver subclasses named 'C<$name>' should be packaged as 
WWW::Scraper::ISBN::$name_Driver, e.g. WWW::Scraper::ISBN::LOC_Driver for the 
LOC (Library of Congress) driver. Each driver need only implement the search()
method, though they may have as many other methods as they need to get their 
job done. Only search() will be called by WWW::Scraper::ISBN->search().
